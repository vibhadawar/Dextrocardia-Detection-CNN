*** Dextrocardia Detection using Deep Learning***

 **Project Overview**

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect Dextrocardia (a rare heart condition where the heart is positioned on the right side of the chest) from chest X-ray images.

1.Built using TensorFlow/Keras

2. Preprocessed medical image dataset
 
3.Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

4.Deployed with Flask + Ngrok for testing on Google Colab
